olscrbl - command line offline scrobbling client

How to build the application?

  Make sure GNU guile is installed (preferably guile 2.0 or better) and call:

    % make all

  To generate the manual page, make sure txt2tags is installed and call:

    % make doc

  That's all.

But I want XDG paths for my configuration...

  With with above calls, add XDG="#t", like this:

    % make all doc XDG="#t"

  To make sure everything was rebuild, in case you built without XDG support
  before, do:

    % make clean
